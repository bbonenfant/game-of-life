Game of Life
============

This is an implementation of 
  [Conway's Game of Life](wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

Currently this will only run a randomized "seed" of this cellular
  automaton.
  
To run this, install the dependencies using the 
  [poetry](poetry.eustace.io) package.
Then you can start the app by running the following command from 
  the root of this project:
```bash
python -m game
```


### Possible Improvements
* Creating an applet to specify starting configurations.
* Loading and saving configurations.
* Optimizations.
